    <string name="book_description">World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned
        to a Swiss research facility to analyse a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered
        physicist. What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church
        by a centuries-old underground organisation &#8212; The Illuminati. Desperate to save the Vatican
        from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and mysterious
        scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt though sealed crypts,
        dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth&#8230;the
        long-forgotten Illuminati lair.</string>
